AutoFormhcj folder: In this folder, I have created a From.
This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project provides a simple and responsive personal form. The form includes fields for the user's name, email, message, and some other fields. The styling ensures a clean and user-friendly interface with a subtle background color and well-spaced elements.

Upon filling out the form and clicking the "Submit" button, the provided JavaScript function (confirmation) collects the input values and redirects to another HTML page.
